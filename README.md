# PythonTerminalGames

## Description üìù
An educational project focused on terminal software installation and Python game development. The repository contains a graphical Tic-Tac-Toe game implementation that demonstrates event-driven programming concepts using Python's turtle graphics library.

The primary system is a complete interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game located in  `tictactoe.py`

## Project Structure üìö
The repository follows a minimal structure designed for educational purposes:
| File         | Purpose                                                          | Type          |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| tictactoe.py | Main game implementation with complete Tic-Tac-Toe functionality | Python Module |
| README.md    | Project documentation and educational context                    | Documentation |

## Context ‚ùî
- **Terminal Software Installation:** Understanding how to install and run Python games from the command line
- **Event-Driven Programming:** Learning how user interactions trigger program responses through the onscreenclick() mechanism
- **Graphics Programming:** Exploring the turtle module for creating visual interfaces
- **State Management:** Understanding how programs maintain and update internal state through the state dictionary
